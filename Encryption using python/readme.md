# Python Message Encryption and Decryption

This Python script allows users to encrypt and decrypt messages using a simple letter-swapping algorithm. The encryption process swaps the positions of even and odd letters in the message, while the decryption process reverses this operation.

## Features

- Encrypt secret messages by swapping even and odd letters
- Decrypt encrypted messages to reveal the original text
- User-friendly graphical interface with Tkinter
- Support for both encryption and decryption operations

## Usage

1. Run the script `encrypt.py`.
2. Choose whether to encrypt or decrypt a message.
3. Enter the secret message when prompted.
4. View the ciphertext or plaintext result in a pop-up window.

## Installation

No additional libraries or dependencies are required. The script utilizes Python's built-in `tkinter` module for the graphical interface.
